# Check the Fridge

Check the Fridge is a web application for creating, storing, and finding recipes based on ingredient input.

This project will use ASP.NET to build a framework further incorporating C# for the backend, and ReactJS for the frontend.

- C#: Meshes well with .NET and is a popular backend language. There is a little bit of group familiarity too.
- ReactJS: A popular industry choice for front-end development that we all want more experience with. There is also some group familiarity here as well.
