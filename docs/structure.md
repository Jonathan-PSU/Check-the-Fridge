As a Group we are thinking of using an OOP approach for this project. We would have our parent class be recipes and have the ingredients 
be the children class. This heirarchal model would give us a simple and structured way to create lists of ingredients and list of recipes for
each individual user to have on their authorized account. This set up will also help make the UI design easier as we have the 
information to display in nice packages we can use to create a clean display of the lists of ingredients/recipes to the user. 

We still need to discuss what variables will be needed for each object as we will be pulling and saving information from a recipe API. This will
lead us to what info is necessary based on what the API provides helping structure the required fields we need for our ingredients/recipe creation methods we provide for the end user.
